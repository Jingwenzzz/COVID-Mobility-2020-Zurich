# COVID-Mobility-2020-Zurich
By using OpenData from the canton or city of Zurich, a set of maps are produced showing changes in some form of mobility before, during and after the lockdown in city Zurich. 

Map of Motorized individual traffic in city zurich_Covid.mp4 is the file showing these changes. ArcGIS Pro is the tool to make the maps. 

The original data file can be downloaded from the GIS OpenData Portal (https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/sid_dav_verkehrszaehlung_miv_od2031). 
IMV.xlsx is the file used for mapping after data cleaning. 

This is a semester project of a GIS course in Geography Dept, Mobility_Zhang Jingwen_17742487.pdf shows the details of how to make the maps.
